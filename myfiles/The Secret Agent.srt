1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,833
Who from our generation didn't dance

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
to this wonderful classic piece

3
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,958
back in the 1960s –

4
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,625
at the "Samba 'Arpége' Club"?

5
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,167
Waldir had an orchestra.

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,250
They played at all the graduation parties.

7
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,750
And that chorus? Who sings it?

8
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,292
– The musicians themselves? – Yes.

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,208
And this friend of yours.

10
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,042
– Yes, I was there too. – Nice.

11
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:04,958
In fact, Waldir himself also sang the chorus.

12
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:06,000
Wonderful.

13
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,500
“Those who lack life, You see, dare not dance

14
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,792
Samba at the 'Arpége' Club Can't be sweeter.”

15
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,250
Let's listen.

16
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,208
“Samba at the 'Arpége' Club,” Luiz Bandeira and Waldir Calmon.

17
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,792
Our story takes place

18
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,042
in Brazil in 1977,

19
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,833
in very mischievous times...

20
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,042
Hey.

21
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,083
Fill it to the top?

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,542
Don’t worry, everything is fine.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,375
– Fill it?   – Well...

24
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,708
Yes, fill it, but...

25
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,500
What happened there?

26
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,208
It happened last Sunday.

27
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,292
The poor devil came with a knife to steal cans of oil...

28
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,167
Rivanildas, the night worker, grabbed a twelve-gauge shotgun.

29
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,708
and shot him in the chest and face.

30
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,333
And he lay there.

31
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,708
The jerk got what he deserved.

32
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,042
Don't worry, you are the customer.

33
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,542
That's not related to you.

34
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,750
Good?

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Well, okay.

36
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,958
Drive a little back.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,417
– Closer to the pump.
– Alright.

38
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,625
– Has he been there since Sunday?
– Yes.

39
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,042
I will tell you the whole story.

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,750
He has been there since the carnival weekend,
Sunday night.

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,208
Rivanildas called the owners.

42
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,833
Me too.

43
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,792
No response.

44
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,667
Rivanildas fled,
so he wouldn't be caught at the crime scene.

45
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,958
He went to the carnival party.

46
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,208
And I stayed here with this mess.

47
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,667
Open the hood.

48
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,500
If I leave,

49
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,875
I will lose my job.

50
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,667
If I stay,

51
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,292
I will be left with decomposing flesh.

52
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,917
I have almost gotten used to this crap.

53
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,042
How much?

54
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,917
– Stop at 120, please.
– Okay.

55
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,708
You didn't call the police?

56
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,125
Oh, the police...

57
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,833
We called them, they said,
that they would come by on Ash Wednesday,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,958
because they have too much work during the carnival.

59
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,667
So far, there’s no sign of them.

60
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,583
Today is Tuesday.
They started to stink yesterday.

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,750
Look at what the dogs are doing?

62
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,292
Hey, dogs!

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,708
Get out of here!

64
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,875
Go away!

65
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,417
Damn bastards, get out!

66
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,167
Get lost!

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,375
What the hell.

68
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,042
Thank you.

69
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,708
Goodbye.

70
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,208
Finally.

71
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,625
Thank you.

72
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,125
FEDERAL HIGHWAY POLICE

73
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,833
He has been there since Sunday.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,125
You weren’t in a hurry.

75
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,333
We didn’t even know about this.

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And I was drowning in this trouble at the time.

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,542
– Good morning, sir.
– Good morning.

78
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,917
Your driver's license and documents, please.

79
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,083
So you’re not here for the body?

80
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,208
Not at all,

81
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,750
my partner asked me to stop and check

82
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,375
the yellow "Beetle."

83
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,083
Please show me the fire extinguisher.

84
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,708
Could you step out of the car, sir?

85
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,500
Why?

86
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,167
I need to get inside the car.

87
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,333
You can trust me.

88
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,833
Is it really necessary?

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

90
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,583
Please step out.

91
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,208
Wait here, okay?

92
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,208
The extinguisher is in order.

93
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,708
Yes...

94
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,333
in order.

95
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,250
No drugs in the car?

96
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,500
You don’t smoke weed?

97
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
No.

98
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,875
Weapons?

99
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
I’m not carrying a weapon.

100
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,208
Drive on, don’t stop.

101
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,833
Nobody wants to stop.

102
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,208
Isn’t that spare tire too worn out?

103
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,042
That’s a good spare tire.

104
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,792
Well, alright.

105
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,542
Listen, sir...

106
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,125
Could you...

107
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,292
donate to the police carnival fund?

108
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,000
Captain...

109
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,708
Not a captain, I’m a sergeant.

110
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,583
Sergeant.

111
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,250
I’ve been driving for three days.

112
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,792
I spent all the remaining money on gasoline.

113
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,667
But if you want...

114
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,583
You can take some of these. Cigarettes.

115
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,750
Can I keep them?

116
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,833
Of course.

117
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,958
Get lost! Get out of here!

118
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,917
Away!

119
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,417
Ugh!

120
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,792
Damn you, stupid fools.

121
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,542
SECRET AGENT

122
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,250
From Pernambuco – to the world.

123
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,958
Good afternoon to the listeners of “Jornal do Commercio”!

124
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,000
DRIVEN BY ME,
GUIDED BY GOD

125
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,083
It's Fat Tuesday.

126
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,125
So, are you enjoying the heartache of betrayal?

127
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,500
Is it hard for you?

128
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,875
Then lean back and enjoy Chicago,

129
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,667
"If You Leave Me Now."

130
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,542
WITCHCRAFT IS A POOR MAN'S TWIST

131
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:24,542
PART 1
BOY'S NIGHTMARE

132
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,958
OCEANOGRAPHY DEPARTMENT

133
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh brother!

134
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,667
- I bless you, father.
- God bless you.

135
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:50,958
Officer Euclid.

136
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,167
Wait a minute.
I need to talk to my men, okay?

137
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,792
Go, step back.

138
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,250
Before going inside...

139
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,417
tell me what's going on.

140
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,958
Well, father...

141
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,792
I think it was that guy
from last week.

142
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,417
What?

143
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,750
What? Are you crazy?

144
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,583
Do you think I would call the father from the carnival

145
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,208
if it wasn't serious?

146
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,458
Who's in charge here?

147
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,667
The artist, from the Kordeiro precinct.

148
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,250
I can't stand that piece of crap.

149
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,750
Fernando isn't here?

150
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,417
He is enjoying the carnival.

151
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,583
- Are there journalists?
- No.

152
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,708
Just one scientist and a few students.

153
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,125
Right or left?

154
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,542
I couldn't see, I was too far away.

155
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,333
Suspicious.

156
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,750
Officer Euclid, you shouldn't have come.

157
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm almost done.

158
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,167
I am Euclid Kavalkančis, police chief.

159
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,417
At your service.

160
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,917
The individual was found on Sunday,
we need to act quickly.

161
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,708
- Don't you have a refrigerator?
- It's broken.

162
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,917
When we were working, we found a part...

163
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,792
that is, a leg.

164
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,750
I started to pull it,
but I decided better not to.

165
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,000
We called the police.

166
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,833
Damn...

167
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,000
Where was that shark found,

168
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,542
or killed?

169
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,583
150 meters from the shore.

170
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,000
There, in Kandeja.

171
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,417
And the leg...

172
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,292
is it a man's?

173
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,000
Better not say anything for now.

174
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,125
That's the work of forensic experts.

175
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,667
- Are you going to cut it with a knife? No need.
- Don't worry, I'm experienced.

176
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,458
You will mess up the individual.

177
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,750
I will remove it myself.

178
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,208
Please wait there.

179
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,542
No knives.

180
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,250
Hand over the gloves.

181
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,292
Professor, just one question.

182
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,750
Did you take photos?

183
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,042
No, there's no photos.

184
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,042
Professor,

185
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,667
was the shark male or female?

186
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,875
Male.

187
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,042
Damn!

188
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,208
Crap!

189
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,583
Mission accomplished.

190
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,167
God, you're soaking wet!

191
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,375
Here.

192
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,875
- Dona Sebastijana?
- Yes, at your service.

193
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,625
- Marselas?
- Yes.

194
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:41,958
- How are you?
- Great.

195
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,083
- I need you to give me a ride.
- Of course, get in.

196
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,292
This is Klovis.
Get on the footrest, boy!

197
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,083
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

198
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,333
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

199
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,667
Let's go.

200
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,167
Did the cops not catch you when they saw your beard?

201
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,167
Today they robbed me!

202
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,125
- How?
- They took my cigarettes.

203
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,750
Don't give them anything!

204
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,708
You can take my cigarettes.

205
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,833
I would never let them take mine.

206
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,667
How long have you been smoking?

207
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,083
Sixty years.

208
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,750
You're kidding! How old is the lady?

209
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:18,125
77, that's what it says on my birth certificate.

210
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,792
I was born in 1900.

211
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,500
Klovis, help him.
Unload the suitcases.

212
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,708
- Can you open the trunk?
- It's open.

213
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,958
Welcome.

214
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,250
- Is this the man?
- Yes.

215
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,083
Welcome!

216
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,667
OFIRO MADHOUSE

217
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,792
I brought beer.

218
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,250
To your arrival.

219
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,250
Holy Mary...

220
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,333
Harold.

221
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,667
Marselas.

222
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,375
Wow...

223
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,208
This party has been going on since seven.
No one has slept for two nights.

224
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, dona Sebastijana!

225
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,625
Let's go inside, you need to rest.

226
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,667
- See you.
- Welcome.

227
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,125
Look who's here!

228
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,250
Teresa Victoria.

229
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,625
This is Marselas, he just arrived.

230
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:47,667
Hello.

231
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,708
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

232
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,375
This is Antonijus, her husband.
They are from Angola.

233
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,042
How are things over there?

234
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,833
Oh, it's a long story.

235
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,208
We can sit down and I'll tell you.

236
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,083
Dona Sebastijana,
they're very noisy today, aren't they?

237
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,375
Don't worry, I'll ask them to lower the music.

238
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,833
My head is splitting.

239
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,208
- I'll take care of that.
- Okay.

240
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,750
- Welcome.
- Thank you, I hope you feel better.

241
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,583
- See you.
- Nice to meet you.

242
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,833
This is Ofiras.

243
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,542
I've been living here for twenty years.

244
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,667
And this is my niece Žeisa's apartment.

245
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,667
I prepared everything for you.

246
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,792
You really prepared everything!

247
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,042
- Everything looks nice and tidy.
- A wonderful apartment.

248
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,958
Completely furnished.

249
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,292
I asked Klovis to clean everything.

250
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,167
Can I put these in the bedroom?

251
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,125
Yes, Klovi.

252
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:50,417
He cleaned the whole apartment and dusted.

253
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,625
But that wasn't enough for me,
so I brought some incense,

254
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,750
rue leaves, and coarse salt yesterday.

255
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,958
And I performed a cleansing ritual.

256
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,000
You are wonderful.

257
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:05,167
- Feel at home.
- Thank you very much.

258
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,750
And you? Do you go to school?

259
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,917
- No, I don't go.
- Why?

260
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,375
He arrived here last month from Rio Formoso.

261
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,458
He ran away from his father and uncle.

262
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,042
They wanted to make him the kind of man
they want him to be.

263
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,875
Klovis is a man.

264
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,458
- Right, Klovi?
- Yes, I am a man.

265
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,458
Just not the kind they want.

266
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,458
That's why he helps me here.

267
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,958
He does everything I ask: waters the plants,

268
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,167
picks mangoes, does everything.

269
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,917
And after the soap opera

270
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,708
he goes to sleep.

271
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,792
We'll see about school later.

272
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,583
You have to go to school.

273
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,333
So, there's a cat at home.

274
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,250
Dona Sebastijana, what's this?

275
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,708
Are you allergic to cats?

276
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,375
No, I like cats, but...

277
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,792
They were born in the village.

278
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,167
They were going to be put to sleep, Žeisa brought them here.

279
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,167
Here are Liza and Eliza.

280
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,292
- Liza and Eliza? - Yes.

281
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,667
Liza and Eliza...

282
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,542
Do they live in the apartment?

283
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,917
Sort of.

284
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:32,208
When Žeisa left, she left the cats with me.

285
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:37,750
They lived upstairs with me,
but they always came down and scratched the door.

286
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,042
Then I thought, "God,

287
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,125
they miss Žeisa so much that they'll break the door."

288
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:46,333
So I asked Klovis to cut this hole,
it's terrible.

289
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,708
I said it would look ugly.

290
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:49,667
Yes, you did.

291
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,583
It's my fault, dear.

292
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,875
But it looks ugly, you can't deny that.

293
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,250
They ruined the door.

294
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,125
Now the cats and dogs walk back and forth.

295
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,833
Girls, this is Marselas, I was talking about.

296
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,792
Marselas, this is Joana.

297
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,042
And that rounder one is Marija.

298
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,708
Hello.

299
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,042
Sorry.

300
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,458
They work in the building.

301
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,375
Good afternoon, dona Sebastijana.

302
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:21,000
My new neighbor Klaudija
and her daughter Debora.

303
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,125
- Hello.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

304
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,167
Nice to meet you.

305
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,083
What's with the girl's head?

306
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,667
Lice.

307
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,292
They covered her completely.

308
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,583
Klaudija is a teacher and a dentist.

309
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,875
Divorced!

310
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,917
She's wonderful.

311
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,208
- She came to see you.
- Stop it.

312
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,167
Of course not.

313
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,917
Everything will be alright.

314
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,333
I just stopped by.

315
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,208
I have a hard time keeping my tongue behind my teeth.

316
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,542
- Oh dear, dona Sebastijana, please...
- No matter what happens...

317
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,000
No need, dona Sebastijana.

318
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,917
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

319
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,417
- Welcome to our home.
- Thank you.

320
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,167
If you need anything, I live upstairs.

321
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,250
- The floor above?
- Yes.

322
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,458
- Is Klovis there?
- Yes.

323
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,208
I'll ask him to buy cigarettes.

324
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,917
It was nice to meet you.

325
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,292
Now you've seen everything.

326
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,792
I have something for you.

327
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,375
Here you go.

328
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,667
You have to be there very early on Friday morning.

329
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:24,458
- At five in the morning.
- Thank you.

330
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,708
I'm glad I can help.

331
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:59,208
I found a house by the sea.

332
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:06,750
There are coconut palms and a hammock;
we can hang it.

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,417
And then, my dear,

334
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:21,833
I will feel love in your embrace.

335
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,750
In the wonderful radiance.

336
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,083
And then...

337
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:31,417
We will walk the road no longer just the two of us.

338
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,250
NASRAI

339
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,875
So many sharks.

340
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,833
Yes, grandpa.

341
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,792
I’m drawing the movie poster.

342
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,250
When will I be able to see it?

343
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,250
Fernanda, it can be watched from age 14.

344
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,542
Besides, you'll have nightmares.

345
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,583
I'm already having nightmares, grandpa.

346
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,042
I won't have peace, will I?

347
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,458
Dona Lenira, I'm going to visit my son.

348
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,750
Do you really think you should be here?

349
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,417
I want to see Fernanda, Mr. Aleksandras.
Is he there?

350
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,708
Fernanda.

351
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:48,125
There was a leg inside the shark.

352
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,750
Were you scared? A human leg?

353
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes, a human leg.

354
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:57,458
- Did you see it on TV?
- On grandpa's radio.

355
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,708
You can't see anything on grandpa's radio.

356
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:02,542
You can only hear it.

357
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,375
We need to find...

358
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:08,542
that man who lost his leg and attach it again.

359
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,708
With a screw or...

360
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,333
a little glue, or a string.

361
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,458
- Or sew it.
- Yes.

362
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,167
With that thing.

363
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,500
Dad, can mom be here with us now?

364
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,917
Now mom's memory is with us.

365
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:42,083
When we think of someone,
that person seems to be with us.

366
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,500
But can she come back?

367
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,667
No, son.

368
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,208
Mom got sick and died.

369
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,125
She won't return.

370
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,292
Do you remember when you caught a cold and had a high fever?

371
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,375
Yes, I remember.

372
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:10,417
When there is pneumonia,
the temperature rises much higher.

373
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:14,542
Wow! Up to 50 degrees?

374
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,417
Up to 50.

375
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,208
It's very sad, isn't it?

376
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes, but you and I are here.

377
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,458
Mom is also with us – in our memory.

378
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:33,333
I don't live with you now just because
I can't.

379
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,083
But that's why I came here.

380
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,292
Okay?

381
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,917
So we can live and be together forever.

382
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,375
You and I.

383
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,917
STATE OF SAN PAULO

384
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,000
This "in the city" plays all the time.

385
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:51,917
Really?

386
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,167
What about the women?

387
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,667
Good.

388
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,042
SÉRGIO MOTTA DAM

389
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,333
There's Oliveira.

390
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,000
- Oliveira!
- Lieutenant.

391
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,750
You know, I usually don’t ask, but...

392
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,750
I got curious.

393
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,125
Who's that old lady at the end?

394
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,458
What's it to me if I tell you?

395
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,208
Snitch.

396
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,875
Damn.

397
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,208
Go to hell.

398
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,167
What's that woman to you?

399
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,917
I'm curious.

400
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:10,083
Like an itch you can't scratch, right?

401
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,500
Inheritance and envy.

402
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,125
They just arrived.

403
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm almost done.

404
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,542
That's the person.

405
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,125
Looks like he fled to Recife.

406
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:39,250
I’ll find out more and report back.

407
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:40,875
Is he white, indigenous,

408
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,292
mulatto, or black?

409
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,667
He's white.

410
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,542
What does he do?

411
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,708
It's written in the document.

412
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,083
That one on the right,

413
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,583
with the beard.

414
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,625
A man like him...

415
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,500
As you can understand,
costs more.

416
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,042
I’ll take 60,000 cruzados.

417
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,708
Plus travel, accommodation, and other expenses.

418
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,333
I’ll pay 40,000.

419
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,167
I want first-class services.

420
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,042
And I don’t want any problems.

421
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,917
Don’t contact me anymore.

422
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,792
Pretend I'm not here.

423
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,292
Handle it yourselves.

424
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,250
With all due respect, Mr. Giroči...

425
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,750
Giroti!

426
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,542
Mr. Giroči.

427
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,417
We’ve already won several battles together.

428
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:51,500
There’s no point in pretending we’re negotiating,

429
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,083
When you know that my price is fair.

430
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,125
60,000 cruzados.

431
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,333
30,000 now.

432
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,375
30,000 later.

433
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,625
– Are you two always together?
– Always.

434
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,875
Yes.

435
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:07,250
We will sign the contract together.

436
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,208
If you don't agree,

437
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,583
I will understand and respect it.

438
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,792
These holidays passed in an instant.

439
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,417
He is a scoundrel.

440
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,792
I want...

441
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,583
a hole.

442
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,167
A hole?

443
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,708
In his mouth.

444
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,417
Make him mute, do you understand?

445
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,708
You can be calm.

446
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,167
Okay.

447
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,417
Let it be 60,000.

448
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:10,292
Is there no cavity?

449
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,583
I have dental calculus.

450
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,625
Here. I found one.

451
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,083
And it's huge.

452
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,250
Be careful.

453
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,750
Marcel!

454
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:28,167
Yes, Dona Sebastiana?

455
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:32,083
They brought the products. Come meet Valdemar.

456
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,000
- Your time is up. - Oh no, not yet!

457
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,125
I don't want to kiss.

458
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,208
What do you mean?

459
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,792
We've already kissed too much.

460
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,375
Then that's okay.

461
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,833
Do you know the story of Zeus?

462
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,667
Dona Sebastiana's niece?

463
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,458
The owner of these beds,

464
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,042
of this house.

465
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,000
I was told that she left all her belongings behind.

466
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,083
That’s not true.

467
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,125
She was killed by her fiancé.

468
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,458
Angry that she got a scholarship to study in Germany.

469
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,292
What are you saying?

470
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,958
– A great tragedy. – Yes.

471
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,250
How do you know that?

472
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,250
Dona Sebastijana told me.

473
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,417
I noticed that she tells others a different version.

474
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,917
Dona Sebastijana.

475
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,500
– Hello. – How are you doing?

476
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,458
Good, there have been worse times.

477
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,208
But at 77, I'm doing great.

478
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,333
Joana.

479
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,917
Good morning.

480
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,250
Good morning.

481
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,958
Are you ready, dear?

482
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,292
You called, madam?

483
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,333
Can you take my groceries?

484
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,667
Where were you?

485
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,375
I helped a man who had a toothache.

486
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,208
Is he causing you problems?

487
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,125
I'm causing him problems. He's in good hands.

488
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,792
I've fallen in love with this woman.

489
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,417
- Our guardian.
- Yes.

490
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,375
He is well taken care of.

491
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,583
So, tell me, do you bring him every week?

492
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,625
Every Thursday.

493
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,000
My parents have a farm.

494
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,917
We gather what is left,

495
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,958
and I bring fruits, vegetables...

496
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,625
- So we don't have to go there?
- Yes.

497
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,042
Maria!

498
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:46,000
- Dona Sebastijana.
- Hello.

499
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,500
- Good morning, Valdemar.
- Good morning.

500
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:50,042
Hello, Marselai.

501
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:53,250
Just checking our products, the refugees'?

502
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,083
Do you have mangabas today?

503
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,000
No, there are no mangabas left.

504
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,583
Maybe let's avoid that word, okay?

505
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,958
We don't use it here.

506
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,833
"Mangaba"?

507
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,417
"Refugee".

508
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,458
And what are we then?

509
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,083
Flavija.

510
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,792
Wait.

511
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,458
- Can you repeat?
- Which date are you referring to?

512
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,167
February 25, 1977.

513
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,125
And you?

514
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:55,542
The tape from 1978.

515
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,708
Sebastijanos.

516
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,083
Alright.

517
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,667
The agreement was as follows:

518
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:10,333
he was supposed to come to the office at 5 a.m.

519
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,333
and invite Anisijus,

520
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,125
who was our contact.
He did just that.

00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,750
Budinkis.

523
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,917
Stay alert.

524
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,417
"A man's foot found in a shark..."

525
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,583
There is nothing here and there will never be anything
that I don't already know.

526
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,167
Look.

527
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,708
"Agronomy student still missing."

528
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:44,833
Lord, what a disaster...

529
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,833
We couldn't have known,
that he was a good guy.

530
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,042
How were we supposed to know?

531

ROBERTO SANTELMO
IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS SERVICE

532
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,250
Look.

533
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,750
Why are you so worried about

534
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:16,500
what the newspapers are saying?

535
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:20,042
Because there might be some petty communists

536
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,625
trying to fool us, son.

537
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:27,958
As long as there is no body, everything will be fine.

538
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,000
One foot won't lead them anywhere.

539
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:31,375
Oh, what now...

540
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,500
with that foot?

541
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,417
It's in the city morgue.

542
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,083
Marselas?

543
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes. Anisijus?

544
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,042
You are punctual.

545
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,000
I was told to come early.

546
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,667
We were all told to do the same.

547
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,958
Let's go inside.

548
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,458
– Das Doresa?
– Yes?

549
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,583
– Please, bring coffee and water.
– Okay.

550
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,458
– No need for a lot of sugar.
– Of course.

551
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,792
– You don't have a São Paulo accent.
– I’m from Pernambuco.

552
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,167
Ah, I see.

553
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:45,833
But your Pernambucan accent
is kind of strange.

554
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,750
Gerald, at this table, please.

555
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,000
Good morning, Dona Dagmara.

556
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,917
Let’s act like it’s a regular workday, okay?

557
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,417
Sit at that table.

558
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,667
– Where should I sit?
– At the back.

559
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,542
There, at the last table.

560
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:07,708
Today we are here to
assist Police Chief Euclid,

561
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,792
whom you saw downstairs.

562
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,667
The facility opens to visitors at seven.

563
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,250
Then you will start working.

564
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:21,125
We arrived at five, but it only opens at seven?

565
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:24,417
Yes. You’ll have time to settle in.

566
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:25,750
And most importantly –

567
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,167
we have a quorum.

568
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,583
A quorum for what?

569
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,000
Mrs. Formiga.

570
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:02,875
No, Elisandra.

571
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,500
I’m waiting for a delivery of clothes this morning.

572
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,000
Could you keep an eye on it?

573
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,833
And tell the boy.

574
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,417
Thank you.

575
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,792
Would you like some [chicken pie]?

576
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,000
Of course.

577
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:21,792
It looks delicious.

578
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,875
I put three on your account.

579
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,083
– A pie, newbie?
– No, thank you.

580
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,083
Just a cruise with a half.

581
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,875
Thank you, I already had breakfast.

582
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:34,125
Really?

583
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,500
You can use this room.

584
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,500
– I reserved it for you.
– Thank you.

585
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,500
Hey, everyone.

586
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:25,042
You have been invited.

587
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,875
Stay here, okay?

588
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,292
Who is that woman?

589
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,208
A girl of about three years old was hit by a car.

590
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,042
and died near her home.

591
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,458
She was the daughter of a housekeeper.

592
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,000
That's why the police chief Euclid...

593
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:58,958
asked Anisius to gather all of us
before the start of work.

594
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,708
We arrived early for that woman's testimony.

595
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,708
Is this the police station?

596
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,167
No.

597
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:13,583
But today this is the police station,
to make it more convenient for the wealthy lady.

598
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,375
What a heartless woman.

599
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,625
She sent the maid to buy some bread,

600
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,208
and left the poor girl alone, crying.

601
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,708
The gates were open.

602
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,833
The girl went out – maybe after her mother.

603
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:31,875
And she was hit by a bus.

604
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:36,250
It seems that they didn't even tell the girl's mother,

605
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:39,167
that the location and time of the testimony had been changed.

606
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,125
People,

607
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:42,708
please return to your tables.

608
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:44,000
Please.

609
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,792
Let's cooperate with Police Chief Euclid.

610
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:51,708
People.

611
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,542
Good morning.

612
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,833
Thank you very much for coming.

613
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,083
The questioning will take place in my office.

614
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:05,417
Please work as if it's just an ordinary workday.

615
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:10,083
After the testimonies, photojournalists will take pictures.

616
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:13,917
Please cooperate with Police Chief Euclid.

617
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,292
I am doing what I've been instructed to.

618
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,833
Dear newbie, are you married?

619
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,917
and/or do you enjoy the company of women?

620
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,458
Yes.

621
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,500
But...

622
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:54,250
I like...

623
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,000
I enjoy.

624
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,125
But it's...

625
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,208
complicated.

626
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,625
CARNIVAL VICTIMS: 91

627
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,750
HUMAN LEG FOUND IN SHARK'S STOMACH

628
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,708
There will be more than 100.

629
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,500
You can be sure of that.

630
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,625
More than 100 dead?

631
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,792
No doubt about it.

632
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,083
- Are you a police officer?
- No.

633
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,792
You look like a police officer.

634
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,375
No, I'm not a police officer.

635
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,083
Euclid Oliveiras Kavalkančis.

636
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,042
- At your service.
- Marselas.

637
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,750
Marselas... what?

638
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:20,500
Alvešas.

639
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,167
Marselas Alvešas.

640
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,917
The name of a police officer.

641
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,167
No, I'm not a police officer.

642
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:44,125
A photojournalist is coming now.

643
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:47,042
That woman is suffering a lot.

644
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,167
Kids are a big trouble.

645
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,750
But anyway, I am the police chief.

646
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,333
My office is next door.

647
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,833
- If you need anything, feel free to ask.
- Thank you very much.

648
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,333
The one who is coming now...

649
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,833
This is Anisijus.

650
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,333
- Have you met him?
- Euklidas.

651
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,125
He starts working with us today.

652
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,542
Highly recommended.

653
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:19,500
I will show you the archives room.

654
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,833
- Yes.
- Where we keep the archives.

655
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,042
If you need anything, I will gladly help.

656
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,583
Nice to meet you.

657
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,833
That…

658
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,583
Police chief Euklidas
- is quite a character.

659
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,917
Oh, him.

660
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:37,375
An imperfect man.

661
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,708
Better to keep him close.

662
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,625
On the other hand,

663
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,500
his white son,

664
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,625
Seržas…

665
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,417
God, help us…

666
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,167
Let's go, chief.

667
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,875
It's you again, Deziderijus?

668
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,958
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

669
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,292
At this time, chief.

670
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,375
My routine is getting disrupted.

671
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,917
Go to the main doors.

672
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:26,625
Lord...

673
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,042
A true lover of whores. Damn it.

674
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:40,458
- This is your workplace.
- Alright.

675
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,917
Jesus Christ!

676
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:47,625
- Don’t mind the greeting.
- It's all fine.

677
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:50,333
Your job is constant movement.

678
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,917
This is where identity cards are renewed.

679
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,750
I worked here from 1966

680
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,042
to 1973.

681
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:06,667
Too many dead.

682
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:08,875
Say the name.

683
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,375
Maria Aparecida dos Santos.

684
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,667
You're not tricking me, are you?

685
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,500
Your mother?

686
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,583
It’s easier with the father's name.

687
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,167
Alright, then try...

688
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,125
Lorinaldo Fernandes de Melo Solimojesas.

689
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:30,750
"Solimojesas"...

690
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,250
Now that’s a name!

691
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,458
Everything else is just an addition.

692
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,583
Lorinaldo...

693
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:41,417
Lorinaldo Fernandes.

694
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,083
Lorinaldo Fernandes.

695
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes, there he is.

696
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:03,292
- Still a student.
- The father's name is easier.

697
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,000
I’ll be right back.

698
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:15,000
Marsela,

699
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,583
I'm here to help you.

700
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,042
I work with Elza.

701
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,417
I won’t say anything else.

702
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:26,917
Do you hear?

703
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,708
- Is that the girl's mother?
- The one who died?

704
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,000
Our orders are to let no one in.

705
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,542
I know she’s in there!

706
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,292
You cannot enter, ma’am.

707
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,625
Dona Kleidi!

708
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:37,958
Don’t touch me!

709
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:41,000
Dona Kleidi, I know you’re in there!

710
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,500
I know you’re in there!

711
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:48,875
I want to go in. I want to talk to her.

712
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,417
I want her to tell me that to my face!

713
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:54,292
Let me go!

714
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,917
Dona Kleidi, I know you’re in there!

715
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,750
I want to hear why you did this.

716
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:06,792
Why did you leave my daughter alone?

717
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:10,542
You won’t let my client enter a public building!

718
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,000
Get away!

719
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,333
Look, who’s by the phone booth.

720
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,792
What’s new, buddy?

721
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,958
Let’s cross the street.

722
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:44,000
I have something to show you, you’ll like it.

723
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,333
- Now?
- Yes.

724
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,875
I will introduce you to a great guy.

725
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:53,792
I take my husbands there too, you can come along.

726
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,250
- Chief Euclid, right?
- At your service. Let’s go.

727
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,125
- Across the street?
- It won’t take long.

728
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:03,083
I need to make a call.
Is it necessary now?

729
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,792
He’s there now.

730
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,208
Your father likes you. You’re lucky.

731
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:08,833
Let’s go.

732
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,458
Across the street?

733
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,000
Across the street.

734
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,708
Once upon a time there was a king,

735
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,292
who had a big flea,

736
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,000
whom he loved very much

737
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,708
like his son...

738
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,333
[in Portuguese] 38.

739
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,042
He sent for his tailor.

740
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:36,583
The tailor came...

741
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,042
Here!

742
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,750
Hans!

743
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:41,542
My friend!

744
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,542
I recognize that voice.

745
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,583
Hello, old buddy. Where’s Hansas?

746
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,083
I brought a friend to meet him.

747
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,500
Tell him I’m not here.

748
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,375
How are you, Chief Euclid?

749
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:07,000
Couldn’t we do this another time?

750
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,792
- Can I come in? Hans!
- Sir...

751
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,125
Chief Euclid is here!

752
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,750
Hans!

753
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:18,792
Good morning!

754
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,917
My German friend!

755
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,875
I want to introduce you to my friend.

756
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,375
Marsela, this is Hans.

757
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:32,208
A real German soldier
from World War II.

758
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,000
This man has stories to tell!

759
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:36,708
Not today.

760
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,917
Tired.

761
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:46,125
Show the scars

762
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,792
to my children and friend.

763
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,333
Chief Euclid...

764
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:54,250
We appreciate your work in the district.

765
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:57,542
But please come back another time.
Hans is not feeling well today.

766
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,792
Chief, please.

767
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:02,000
Let me just exchange a few words with Hans.

768
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,708
I just want to see his scars.

769
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,708
Not today,

770
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:08,208
tired.

771
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:10,125
Tired!

772
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:14,167
Hans, you don’t have to do that.

773
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:17,750
Damn! The black guy speaks German!

774
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:20,458
Dad, I think he's not in the mood.

775
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,458
Hans,

776
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:22,833
listen.

777
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,292
Show us the bullet holes

778
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,625
in your legs.

779
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,583
Well, show it.

780
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,625
I think,

781
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:36,667
he doesn't want to talk.

782
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,167
Show the scars.

783
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,458
Are there sharks in Germany?

784
01:02:57,917 --> 01:02:58,833
Gunshot wounds?

785
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:02,542
– Impressive!
– Damn it.

786
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:05,417
– Really disgusting.
– Didn’t I say?

787
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:09,917
Germany?

788
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,125
Belgium.

789
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,833
That's enough, do you want more?

790
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,167
Hans...

791
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,833
I'm doing this for us.

792
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,958
This idiot

793
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,708
ensures your and our safety.

794
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,958
He will never understand,

795
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:37,208
that you are Jewish.

796
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:39,167
Never.

797
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,458
Get out!

798
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,042
Get out of my office!

799
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,792
And take your friends with you.

800
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:46,792
Get out!

801
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:50,000
You can only speak like that because

802
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,792
you are a soldier from World War II.

803
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,542
Now get out!

804
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,000
Damn!

805
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:04,417
BRAZIL – FEDERAL DISTRICT

806
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,667
“Costa and Carpinheiro” partners, how can I help?

807
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,250
I would like to speak to João Pedro.

808
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,042
I’ll connect you right away.

809
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,042
Mr. João, our friend.

810
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:18,833
Connecting now.

811
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,750
Hello, João. What's going on?

812
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:29,625
Listen carefully. I hope you are okay.

813
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:31,500
Don’t say where you are.

814
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:34,042
– Why?
– This call is not secure.

815
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,292
Our phones are being monitored.

816
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:39,625
Listen, we can only talk on a secure line.

817
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,208
– Hang up now.
– João…

818
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,208
I will hang up...

819
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,708
Send me the number, and I will call you.

820
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,750
How do I send the number?

821
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:49,917
Damn it!

822
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:09,833
Telegram.

823
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:16,917
PHONE NUMBER 216180.

824
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:18,542
INTERNAL 22.

825
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,958
I’LL BE WAITING FOR CONTACT AT 5:30 PM. THE END.

826
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:51,042
– Hello.
– Hello.

827
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,917
Telegram.

828
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:02,958
Telegram.

829
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,500
Why did you open it?

830
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:09,125
But I didn’t read it.

831
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:12,792
If you didn’t read it, why did you open it?

832
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,000
I don’t know what to say…

833
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:13,000
“The great dragon has been cast out.

834
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,917
It is the great serpent…”

835
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,167
– Pedras?
– It's me.

836
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:20,667
I would like to speak to Mr. Alexander.

837
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,167
He’s waiting for you.

838
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,208
NO ENTRY

839
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:52,042
Well, and the stairs…

840
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,500
There’s a woman in the lobby…

841
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:58,375
possessed by a spirit.

842
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,292
This is that movie.

843
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,708
– Did I receive calls?
– No.

844
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,750
But someone left a message.

845
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:14,917
Dad, have a good day. Fernanda.

846
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,750
Thank you.

847
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:20,000
Let’s go.

848
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,708
EMPLOYEES ONLY

849
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,417
Are you showing "Nastrus" again?

850
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,958
Pedras scheduled it for Saturday morning.

851
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,375
Because of that shark’s leg in the stomach.

852
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:39,583
People like it.

853
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,375
By the way,

854
01:08:42,042 --> 01:08:46,167
Fernanda really wants to see "Nastrus".

855
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:49,375
I was thinking of bringing him on Saturday.

856
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,250
Are you joking?

857
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,000
I would let him.

858
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,167
It’s too strong for him.

859
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,500
The kid is already having nightmares from the poster.

860
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,292
There…

861
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,875
It happens every day.

862
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,542
Every day.

863
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,750
Fatima loved that window very much.

864
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:10,542
She liked to sit right where you are sitting now.

865
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:15,875
I want to ask you.

866
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:17,667
Looking into your eyes.

867
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:31,417
When you were married to her,

868
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,458
did you often cheat on her?

869
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:39,042
What are you talking about after so long?

870
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:42,833
You cheated, didn’t you?

871
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,083
Mr. Alexander…

872
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,708
Fatima and I loved each other very much.

873
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:56,292
You know better than anyone else, right?

874
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:57,292
I know.

875
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,875
Fernanda is the biggest proof of that.

876
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:01,500
So,

877
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:04,000
you cheated, didn’t you?

878
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:14,917
Wait.

879
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:15,958
Someone is calling you.

880
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,667
Hello, Joan. It worked.

881
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,000
It's nice to hear you and know that you are okay.

882
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,458
I have to speak quickly, I don't have many tokens.

883
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:32,542
He managed to put your name on the Federal Police list.

884
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,500
This means you cannot leave the country.

885
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:36,708
That's very strange.

886
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,583
I can't travel?

887
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:40,792
I'm trying to comprehend this.

888
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:43,042
He is manipulating.

889
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,958
This is a high-level dirty game.

890
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,792
I’m telling you,

891
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:51,333
he removed a serious prosecutor from the case –

892
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,000
favorable to the regime, but serious –

893
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,833
and replaced him with a fraudster,

894
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,250
…his friend.

895
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,708
Damn!

896
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,833
I have to say,

897
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,375
the situation is very bad.

898
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:03,792
So please,

899
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,458
don’t stick your head in,

900
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,292
stay in the shadows.

901
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,250
This is my last token.

902
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,333
Listen carefully.

903
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:13,458
Elza

904
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,583
is now the most important figure in this story.

905
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,625
Elza.

906
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,708
A great place.

907
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,958
A technician from Rio stays here.

908
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,000
This way he saves on hotel costs.

909
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:25,792
– Mr. Alexander?
– Alexander de Jesus do Nascimento.

910
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,750
– I’m Elza.
– Nice to meet you.

911
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,792
– I’m Valdemar.
– Hello.

912
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,833
How should I address you?

913
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,500
You can call me by my name here – Armando.

914
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,750
It’s a great honor to speak with you here.

915
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:42,125
Didn’t you say you were using a fake name?

916
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,292
Isn’t that bad?

917
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,500
Yes, not very good.

918
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:54,042
And thank you for the free tickets.
We just watched a movie.

919
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,625
Did you like it?

920
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:59,583
I’m not a religious person, but it was scary.

921
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,083
Valdemar almost wet his pants.

922
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,958
I don’t like horror movies.

923
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,250
Can I record our conversation?

924
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,292
Record whatever you want.

925
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:20,917
Recording.

926
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,208
It’s similar to

927
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,625
American witness protection programs.

928
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,292
There, everything is done with big resources

929
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,625
and government funds.

930
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:42,917
And here everything is somewhat improvised, Brazilian style.

931
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,625
And aimed at protecting you from Brazil.

932
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,042
How many people do you protect?

933
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,458
With you – four people in Recife.

934
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:56,208
Two more in Fortaleza and one in Salvador.

935
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:00,000
Are we all in the same house in Recife?

936
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:05,667
Look, each case is different.

937
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:09,042
– So, we all help each other.
– Yes.

938
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,125
And who pays for all this?

939
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,583
It is paid for by the daughter…

940
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:21,375
from a very wealthy family in São Paulo…

941
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,708
that has been tearing the country apart for a long time.

942
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,167
How did work go today?

943
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:34,083
So, you hired me at the police station –

944
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,292
are you serious?

945
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,333
No, it’s not a police station.

946
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,417
You applied to the Identification Documents Department.

947
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,417
Yes.

948
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,583
I will try to find

949
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,167
the only document proving,

950
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,708
that my deceased mother actually existed.

951
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,750
But today that place was a police station.

952
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,250
With the police chief and everything.

953
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,958
Did you two talk?

954
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:01,708
He’s a real jerk,

955
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:03,458
a son of a bitch.

956
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,500
The worst part is,

957
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
it seemed like he liked me.

958
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:12,417
Just know – we have an ally there.

959
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:14,000
Anisius.

960
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,583
Is it safe for him to know who I am?

961
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,542
Anisius helps.

962
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:23,792
But he doesn’t know who you are and what we are doing with you.

963
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:27,208
Tell me about the passports.

964
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,583
Mine and my son’s.

965
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:33,083
I don’t know if you know,

966
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:38,125
but I’m on the Federal Police list,
which prohibits me from traveling.

967
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:40,542
Given the situation,

968
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:44,958
we agree that you need a fake passport.

969
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,708
We can take care of that.

970
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:51,750
I can get the documents,
but it will take a few days.

971
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,208
What’s happening here?
I don’t understand.

972
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,917
Why do I need a fake passport?

973
01:16:58,042 --> 01:16:59,958
I haven’t done anything wrong…

974
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,125
And what’s in it for you?

975
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:04,667
Who are you?

976
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,667
I’m a pediatrician.

977
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,542
Just trying to help.

978
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:11,083
Armando, let’s not talk about that now.

979
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,792
Think about your son.
My grandson.

980
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,833
Think about my daughter, Fatima.

981
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:21,000
Mr. Aleksandras, I constantly think about my son.

982
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:24,917
I’m very sorry about your daughter, Mr. Aleksandras.

983
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,417
And your wife, Armando.

984
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:33,250
How could this country lose
such a woman as Fatima?

985
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,750
Brazil will pay dearly for this.

986
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:40,000
I don't agree.

987
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:41,917
With all due respect.

988
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,583
She will not pay anything.

989
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,958
She won't pay a damn thing.

990
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,417
Armando, I admire you,

991
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,500
but you should leave.

992
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,000
If I were you,
I would get out of here as soon as possible.

993
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:58,417
I would accept their help and leave today.

994
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,250
That's why I organized it.

995
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,458
Mr. Aleksandras…

996
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:05,042
We need to protect what we still have.

997
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:07,042
You and my grandson.

998
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,917
I will be in the projector room.
Lock the doors.

999
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,500
We would like to know more

1000
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,083
about Enrique Castro Giroči

1001
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,333
and how he got involved in this.

1002
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,000
I will tell you everything.

1003
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:38,458
I will get all of this

1004
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,708
off my chest.

1005
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:42,750
This is a conversation.

1006
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:44,917
Being recorded.

1007
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,500
Tell me about that…

1008
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:50,833
Enrique Giroči.

1009
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:16,667
I...

1010
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:20,458
I am not a violent person.

1011
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,542
But this man…

1012
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,625
I would kill him even with a hammer.

1013
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,958
I would crush his skull with a hammer.

1014
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:46,625
Are you…

1015
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,458
Do you carry a weapon?

1016
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:56,042
No, but I know how to use a hammer.

1017
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,042
I need to go to the bathroom.

1018
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,542
I need to go to the bathroom.

1019
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:11,083
She paused the recording to go to the bathroom...

1020
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,083
We would like to know more

1021
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,167
about Enrike Castro Giroči

1022
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,333
and how he got involved in this.

1023
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,708
Flavia?

1024
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,000
...about herself.

1025
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:29,333
It's a conversation.

1026
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,458
What dates are you listening to?

1027
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:35,250
- Excuse me?
- What dates are you listening to?

1028
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:38,292
It's Elza with "Marsel," in quotes,

1029
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,667
February 25, 1977.

1030
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:42,792
I haven't finished yet.

1031
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,583
Marselas is Armandas, do you know that?

1032
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:49,000
That's exactly what I just heard,

1033
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,792
and I got confused.

1034
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:53,542
So Marselas is actually Armandas.

1035
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:56,417
- That's a fake name.
- Yes.

1036
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,500
You're smart, Flavia!

1037
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,250
Which ones are you listening to?

1038
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:02,667
Anisija's tapes.

1039
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,417
From '76.

1040
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:05,500
Yes.

1041
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,375
I need to go to the restroom.

1042
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,125
How did you meet Giročius?

1043
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:26,875
He came for a visit to the university.

1044
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:30,667
As the head of the department,

1045
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:35,125
I would sometimes meet guests at the Recife airport.

1046
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:38,542
He was on the board of the state electric company
"Eletrobras",

1047
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:41,083
which belonged to the Ministry of Mining and Energy.

1048
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,583
So, you are Armandas.

1049
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,208
I read your CV.

1050
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,708
I imagined you differently.

1051
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,958
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- Yes. It's hot, isn't it?

1052
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:53,000
What was your first impression?

1053
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,250
About Giročius?

1054
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:55,500
Jerk.

1055
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,833
And his son - another jerk.

1056
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,792
How long have you been the head of the department?

1057
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:06,542
I returned after my postdoctoral studies

1058
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:08,542
about two years ago.

1059
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:12,667
I also made up for the research leave.

1060
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,208
And I was elected.

1061
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,250
Have you ever considered working in industry?

1062
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:22,333
You could use a good cold industrial shower.

1063
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,625
I enjoy doing research.

1064
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,042
Did he say "industrial shower"?

1065
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:30,667
Yes, I needed an "industrial shower."

1066
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,000
When was that?

1067
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,208
That was

1068
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,792
in August 1974.

1069
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:41,208
We introduced him to everyone,

1070
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:42,958
in the department.

1071
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,333
There was Luanda Azevedo,

1072
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,417
Marcellus Vasconcelos, Sebastian Pires...

1073
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:51,000
We showed him the entire building.

1074
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,500
We showed him the laboratories, all the projects...

1075
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,083
The electric autonomy project,

1076
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,750
the electric car project...

1077
01:22:57,917 --> 01:23:00,417
The leather processing machine,

1078
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,583
which was the pride of our department.

1079
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,667
Let me introduce my colleagues.

1080
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:16,083
Hello.

1081
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,375
– Hi.
– So, this is Suzy Shafer...

1082
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,125
– Nice to meet you.
– From the University of Leeds.

1083
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,792
Sendzejus Jeslin
from Quebec Technical University.

1084
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,625
Are you British?

1085
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,917
No. I’m American. From New York.

1086
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:31,083
– But Sendzejus...
– I’m British.

1087
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,000
You’re British?

1088
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:34,417
– Yes.
– Really?

1089
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:37,417
Yes. We studied together in Leeds.

1090
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:39,542
I now live in Quebec.

1091
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:40,958
Of course.

1092
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,833
And here we are.
He’s a great guy.

1093
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:53,542
That's how it was. The next day.

1094
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,833
There was a meeting.

1095
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:59,500
In that meeting, he practically...

1096
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,000
shut us up.

1097
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,333
To save time,

1098
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,750
I'll get straight to the point.

1099
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:12,875
Speaking of "Eletrobras,"

1100
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:14,667
farthest from Pernambuco,

1101
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,750
the work you are doing here,

1102
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:20,417
should be part of the whole, in my opinion.

1103
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,542
You are too independent,

1104
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:26,000
separated from us in the South.

1105
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:30,375
I would like to focus on Rio.

1106
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:33,208
some of your research

1107
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:34,958
and the subjects of the decisions.

1108
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,125
To avoid old discussions about this,

1109
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:40,542
how the work differs in the North and the South.

1110
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,708
I know you speak with a different accent,

1111
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,792
you have a different way of working.

1112
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:51,417
Even your department head – a hairy guy.

1113
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,083
Right, Armand?

1114
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:57,542
Long live the differences, right?

1115
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,875
What I am trying to say is,

1116
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:03,792
I was surprised by what I saw here.

1117
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:04,958
I apologize.

1118
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,167
Just because...

1119
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,000
for clarity.

1120
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:12,542
All our projects are published in the official publication.

1121
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,375
I don’t understand why you’re surprised.

1122
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,583
– Let me finish. – Unless you haven't read it.

1123
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,208
I meant it positively.

1124
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,792
– Just to be clear. – It’s a compliment.

1125
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,458
Alright...

1126
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:27,958
By the way, the leather processing technology...

1127
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:31,333
measuring the area of leather,

1128
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,917
is important to the local culture.

1129
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:37,708
For bulls, goats, cows...

1130
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:41,042
It's important for the economy of the Northeastern region.

1131
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,458
I like it.

1132
01:25:44,292 --> 01:25:47,833
It's a regional center, not a national one,

1133
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,875
Let alone international.

1134
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,000
Let's take a look at the electric car, the project you showed me.

1135
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,500
By the way, Armandas is also working on it.

1136
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:01,500
In Canada, they are being conducted

1137
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:03,375
more advanced research.

1138
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:08,458
In fact, we purchased 12 prototypes from the Canadian consortium.

1139
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:11,000
– Through "Eletrobras." I would like to add...

1140
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:14,917
You and your company are part of that consortium.

1141
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:16,417
"Eletrobras."

1142
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:20,917
"Eletrobras" indeed acquired 12 prototypes from the consortium.

1143
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:22,750
"Eletrobras"?

1144
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:25,542
– Not your company? – "Eletrobras." Can I continue?

1145
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:29,000
So...

1146
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,417
I am curious,

1147
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:34,000
whether taxpayer money

1148
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:36,500
should be spent on such projects.

1149
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:38,875
In the northeast...

1150
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:40,042
He cannot speak seriously,

1151
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:43,458
when they themselves have to deal with so many problems.

1152
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,167
Moreover,

1153
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:50,958
competing with larger ones abroad.

1154
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,208
Mr. Giroci,

1155
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,750
I am Luanda Azevedo, a research professor,

1156
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:58,833
with a degree from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.

1157
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,250
– You are from the South? – Yes.

1158
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:04,083
All our projects are funded.

1159
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,000
from public research funds.

1160
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:09,667
And we have partnership projects,

1161
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:12,833
funded by independent foreign foundations.

1162
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,958
It's time to review your funding criteria,

1163
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:18,333
especially independence.

1164
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:22,042
Luanda was the first to fall.

1165
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,708
She went to work

1166
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,000
in the São Paulo metro,

1167
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:29,792
where that jerk was in the Technical Commission.

1168
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:33,667
Did this happen to the whole team?

1169
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:35,875
Yes.

1170
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,708
It was a real "industrial shower."

1171
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:43,458
He cut funding for state universities

1172
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,375
for personal gain.

1173
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,167
It's just...

1174
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,750
And then I was

1175
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:54,958
poured over with accusations.

1176
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:57,208
I don't know if you know,

1177
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:00,333
but two fabricated articles were published,

1178
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,875
a coordinated attack against you,

1179
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:06,875
In the newspapers of Rio and São Paulo.

1180
01:28:07,042 --> 01:28:08,667
Thank God,

1181
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:12,125
I didn’t see anything in the Recife newspapers.

1182
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:14,083
Everything will pass.

1183
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,375
I hope it will pass.

1184
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:44,917
Mr. Aleksandras,

1185
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:47,708
please sit here so I can see you.

1186
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,125
I didn't tell the story in order.

1187
01:28:57,792 --> 01:29:00,167
The evening before that meeting

1188
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,625
we went to dinner.

1189
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:05,625
I,

1190
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:07,167
Fatima,

1191
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,750
Giročis and his son.

1192
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:16,208
She started as your secretary, right?

1193
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,542
To the restroom.

1194
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,458
What a beautiful woman you have.

1195
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,542
Would you like some water?

1196
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:37,708
Yes, please.

1197
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:45,792
I invited you to dinner with my wife.

1198
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:49,875
And she just said that she is a teacher, right?

1199
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,875
But I know why you’re doing this.

1200
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:57,458
It's for the lithium battery research, right?

1201
01:29:59,292 --> 01:30:01,417
I patented the research.

1202
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,000
It’s my project.

1203
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:08,125
It’s a small breakthrough, but the patent is mine.

1204
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:10,542
Pass the whiskey.

1205
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:15,833
My sense of smell never fails me, does it, son?

1206
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,042
You know me.

1207
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:22,708
This guy uses the university to patent research.

1208
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,500
– I demand respect.  – Don’t tell me...

1209
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:27,667
He uses the public system to reach the market.

1210
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:31,250
We need to shut down all these shitty institutions.

1211
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:33,208
– Easy money, right?  – I demand respect.

1212
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:35,375
Public money is easy money.

1213
01:30:36,417 --> 01:30:39,208
I am the head of the research center you attend.

1214
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,417
I am an employee of the university that accepts you.

1215
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,667
– I can't believe it.  – I knew I had to come here.

1216
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,417
I knew.

1217
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,875
Armand, my field is engineering.

1218
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,875
I run the family business,

1219
01:30:57,917 --> 01:31:00,708
created through sweat and hard work.

1220
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,792
My father is Italian, from Genoa.

1221
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,042
My blood is Italian.

1222
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,250
You have no idea what you're getting into, kid.

1223
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:13,000
You are a communist.

1224
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,042
– I'm not a communist.  – You are.

1225
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,042
Are you a capitalist?

1226
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,833
– More of a communist than a capitalist.  – Listen.

1227
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:30,500
You know the map.

1228
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,208
Brazil.

1229
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:40,792
North.

1230
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,833
Everyone has their own place.

1231
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:47,958
Good job, man.

1232
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,125
Fatima.

1233
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:59,250
I work at the university that accepts you.

1234
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:01,417
I'm not a little kid, as you just called me.

1235
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,125
I demand respect.  Dinner is paid for.

1236
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:07,833
Meeting tomorrow at 8:30.  The car will be there at 8.

1237
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,958
If you want to go, go; if not, don’t go.

1238
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,958
That idiot can stay behind.

1239
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:14,875
Just let me say something quickly.

1240
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:20,917
I got up because I felt the need to urinate and vomit.

1241
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:23,375
As soon as I got up – it passed.

1242
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:24,875
Control your woman.

1243
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,000
You treated us disrespectfully.

1244
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:31,375
Very disrespectfully.

1245
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:32,792
– Let's go.  – Wait.

1246
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:34,792
– No, no...  – Control your woman.

1247
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:37,667
Now you'll listen.

1248
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,917
I was silent all evening out of respect for Armand.

1249
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:47,000
Very disrespectful, especially towards a father in front of his son.

1250
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:53,250
Now I am thinking about my father, who is a humble man.

1251
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,417
He started working at the age of nine.

1252
01:32:57,292 --> 01:32:59,000
This is a man.

1253
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:03,000
This is a man. Do you hear me?

1254
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,125
Like my husband. This is a man.

1255
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:06,208
Let's go.

1256
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,292
But you, you are drunk too.

1257
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:12,542
You should be ashamed. What kind of people are you?

1258
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,958
Oh, the secretary is that bitch who gave birth to you. Go fuck yourself.

1259
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:17,583
– Calm down!
– Go to hell.

1260
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,500
Go to hell yourself.

1261
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,208
– Sit down.
– Armand...

1262
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:24,167
Armand, don't get into this...

1263
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,375
– Everyone has their place.
– Calm down.

1264
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:36,833
I haven't hit anyone since school days.

1265
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:41,000
In the gym in 1950.

1266
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:44,083
And the meeting still happened...

1267
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,792
As I said.

1268
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:53,000
Did Fatima really say that about me?

1269
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:57,625
Yes, Mr. Aleksandras.

1270
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,583
Alright.

1271
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,042
Alright.

1272
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:06,250
Well then...

1273
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,792
Giročius is a criminal.

1274
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:16,083
His place is in prison.

1275
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,125
And when I say that,

1276
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:21,458
I don't mean a farm colony.

1277
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:25,750
He should be in Carandiru.

1278
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:29,708
What he is doing is treason.

1279
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,375
He is a con artist...

1280
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,833
and a murderer.

1281
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:47,625
In your, let's say, "refugee" group,

1282
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:51,875
What I want to make clear the most is your case.

1283
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:56,625
I understand...
Those two foreign universities want me.

1284
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:58,792
They are probably pressuring you.

1285
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:01,042
Not because of that...

1286
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:04,875
Those foreign universities
really want you, that's great.

1287
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:07,042
But let's not talk about that.

1288
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,833
We have been informed that two men were hired.

1289
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,792
to find you in Recife.

1290
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:20,208
That's not good.

1291
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:23,750
They are from the state of Rio, working together.

1292
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:31,333
The senior one is Augustas Borba.

1293
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:35,042
A former soldier, discharged from the army in 1970.

1294
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,958
He was based in Minas Gerais.

1295
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:40,333
He wasn't even needed by the lousy armed forces.

1296
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,000
He is a scum.

1297
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:48,000
The younger one, Bobis, is his stepson.

1298
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:51,625
They say that the stepfather killed Bobi's mother.

1299
01:35:51,792 --> 01:35:54,292
And now they are working together.

1300
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:04,708
They say that hired killers are looking for me?

1301
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:07,417
Yes.

1302
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:12,625
Is Giročis behind that?

1303
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:19,750
And what do you say?

1304
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:23,667
A week, at most ten days.

1305
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:25,833
In your hands in four days.

1306
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,042
Four days?

1307
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,708
Such disrespect.

1308
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:35,125
Fatima, for you.

1309
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:37,833
And to your son, who is with me.

1310
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:40,917
She was so healthy...

1311
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:51,250
Four days?

1312
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:35,875
PERNAMBUCO FORENSIC MEDICAL SERVICE

1313
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:25,125
I need to talk to you about something outside.

1314
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,125
About what?

1315
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:29,458
It’s very important.

1316
01:40:30,042 --> 01:40:32,042
– Why?
– It’s better if we go outside.

1317
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,583
Keep her outside.

1318
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:52,792
Let’s go, Lucius.

1319
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:56,958
We're moving.

1320
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:59,875
Lindinho is probably turning over in his grave.

1321
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,875
Damn!

1322
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:10,292
There will be a bomb here!

1323
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,458
Listen.

1324
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:14,417
"The hairy leg strikes again!"

1325
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:17,750
The cartoon turned out great.

1326
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,208
Hairy leg!

1327
01:42:27,917 --> 01:42:29,375
Hairy leg!

1328
01:42:29,542 --> 01:42:31,375
Hairy leg!

1329
01:42:42,417 --> 01:42:44,208
Piranhas will come out tonight.

1330
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,917
You will throw this crap away, Sergei.

1331
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:51,417
- What?
- You will throw it away.

1332
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,375
Here.

1333
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:55,500
Stop here.

1334
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:57,292
It's good here, alright!

1335
01:43:14,542 --> 01:43:15,875
I will call.

1336
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,583
San Luis movie theater, good evening?

1337
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:31,250
I would like to speak with Mr. Alexander.

1338
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:32,792
I think he has already left.

1339
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:35,167
I will connect you with the booth.

1340
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:36,417
Thank you.

1341
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:49,708
Incoming call.

1342
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:55,208
Could I speak with Mr. Alexander?

1343
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:59,000
He left early today.
Can you tell me who is calling?

1344
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:03,917
I just want to confirm, his name is
Alexander de Chesus do Nasimiento, right?

1345
01:44:04,917 --> 01:44:08,250
I can't help you with that, man.
Leave your name,

1346
01:44:08,417 --> 01:44:09,167
and I will pass it on to him...

1347
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:11,875
What is this...

1348
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,333
It seems his father-in-law works at the San Luis movie theater,

1349
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,667
Not elsewhere.

1350
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:31,667
Now there's a man!

1351
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,167
They are here.

1352
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,792
Damn it.

1353
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:39,958
Look at this tourist!

1354
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,208
My colonel is punctual.

1355
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,083
Look at that hat!

1356
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:47,708
For your sacred honor!

1357
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:50,917
– Police truck?
– Get in.

1358
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:54,042
– Let's go.
– That's what I'm talking about.

1359
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:55,958
Everyone inside!

1360
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,458
This is my colonel.

1361
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,375
"My colonel." Look who's talking.

1362
01:45:21,042 --> 01:45:22,708
My lieutenant.

1363
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:24,792
The lieutenant is my ass.

1364
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:28,125
First lieutenant!
And I am proud of the uniform I once wore.

1365
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,625
Allow me to introduce my stepson – Bobby.

1366
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:31,958
Or Abdias.

1367
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:34,500
On the birth certificate – Abdias.

1368
01:45:35,625 --> 01:45:37,167
He's a big guy.

1369
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:39,750
Is everything okay, Abdias?

1370
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,708
Does he shoot well?

1371
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:44,500
You can't even imagine.

1372
01:45:45,208 --> 01:45:46,333
This is Seržas.

1373
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,000
Mother's son.

1374
01:45:48,167 --> 01:45:50,250
The next one is Arlindas,

1375
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:52,083
He's like a son.

1376
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:54,167
I prefer "Bobis" more, Mr. Euclid.

1377
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:57,583
Leader Euclid, I don't sell sweets on the street,

1378
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,083
Okay?

1379
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:02,500
I didn't spend my whole life for this,

1380
01:46:02,667 --> 01:46:04,875
to be called some "Mr." now.

1381
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:08,083
What even is "Bobis"? Is that a man's name?

1382
01:46:09,667 --> 01:46:12,500
Did we run out of masculine names that day?

1383
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:15,875
Leader Euclid.

1384
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,458
– That's better.
– He's tough, kid.

1385
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:23,000
He doesn't like being called "Mr.," it makes him angry.

1386
01:46:23,167 --> 01:46:25,917
Got it, right? So calm down now.

1387
01:46:26,542 --> 01:46:28,292
Are you here on a mission?

1388
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,417
Well, let's not go there.

1389
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:36,208
Never mix friendship with work, okay?

1390
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:39,542
The carnival was a real show.

1391
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:41,500
Almost 100 missing.

1392
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:45,083
I read about this extravaganza in the newspapers.

1393
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,208
Did a shark even swallow a foot?

1394
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:51,708
A story for tourists.

1395
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:54,333
Speaking of which,

1396
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:57,208
shall we go for a "ride"?

1397
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,292
"Ride"?

1398
01:47:05,792 --> 01:47:07,542
We'll go for a "ride."

1399
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:10,208
Damn, yes. We're definitely going for a "ride."

1400
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:12,333
Where are we going?

1401
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:14,375
Calm down, kiddo.

1402
01:47:14,542 --> 01:47:17,625
Today we are just tourists,

1403
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:19,833
we’re not going for a "ride."

1404
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:25,625
What's the plan?

1405
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,083
Everything is arranged.

1406
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:32,625
Everything is arranged.

1407
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:35,083
One is "157."

1408
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:39,333
The other is "157" and "213."

1409
01:47:40,542 --> 01:47:41,750
They are at the back.

1410
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,000
Already there?

1411
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:49,250
"157" and "213."

1412
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,792
Damn it.

1413
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:53,958
"213" means...?

1414
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,083
Most often rape.

1415
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,833
"157" – "armed robbery with murder."

1416
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,292
Just good guys.

1417
01:50:09,667 --> 01:50:13,917
"Local resident, Pedro Jorge do Nascimento,

1418
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,708
27 years old, student,

1419
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:19,500
living in the Mustardinja district,

1420
01:50:20,083 --> 01:50:23,792
went for a walk in the evening in May 13th Park.

1421
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:28,000
with a friend, Alexandrino Borges, 32 years old.

1422
01:50:28,167 --> 01:50:32,125
a dental prosthetist, living in the Bomba do Emeterio district,

1423
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:35,042
when they were unexpectedly

1424
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:38,042
a shadow pounced on them, emerging from nowhere.

1425
01:50:38,542 --> 01:50:40,250
and began to kick them.

1426
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:47,333
It's so strange.

1427
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:50,333
Strange, but we all know what this is, don’t we?

1428
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:56,917
But the newspaper writes about it as if it were news!

1429
01:50:57,083 --> 01:51:00,125
Teresa, read about that attack. Amazing.

1430
01:51:00,292 --> 01:51:01,167
Read it.

1431
01:51:01,333 --> 01:51:02,958
– But you've already read it.
– I have.

1432
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:06,000
But it sounds much better with your English accent.

1433
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:08,750
Thank you.

1434
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,417
Oh my dear!

1435
01:51:39,583 --> 01:51:40,875
Hello everyone.

1436
01:51:43,042 --> 01:51:45,083
– Hello.
– Oh, my dear.

1437
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:47,333
– Is everything okay?
– Yes.

1438
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,167
Marcel, I'm glad you came to say goodbye.

1439
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:52,292
Dona Sebastijana told me.

1440
01:51:52,458 --> 01:51:54,708
– I wanted to be with you. – Hello!

1441
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:59,167
I’m Gerald, Sebastiana's friend.

1442
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,042
"Hairy Leg" is very popular in Casa Amarelo.

1443
01:52:03,208 --> 01:52:05,375
A bit anarchic, isn't it?

1444
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:09,500
– Can I call?
– If not long-distance.

1445
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:12,250
Help me with the dishes, Klovi.

1446
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:18,458
I don't like Recife.

1447
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:24,083
They didn't treat me well here.

1448
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:27,167
I'm sorry for calling so late.

1449
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:30,917
I would like to leave a message for Mr. Alexander.

1450
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,583
I really want to talk to my son.

1451
01:52:34,083 --> 01:52:36,667
It's a strange city, but...

1452
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,667
That's fine.

1453
01:52:39,125 --> 01:52:41,750
The "Hairy Leg" that jumps,

1454
01:52:41,917 --> 01:52:44,750
would be a hit in Luanda!

1455
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:46,917
Thank you, Suleika.

1456
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,333
Thank you.

1457
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,917
– Is this sugarcane vodka?
– Yes.

1458
01:52:58,792 --> 01:53:00,792
Long live Mr. Marselas.

1459
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:05,167
Marselas is your fictional name, right?

1460
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:08,458
Marselas...

1461
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:12,833
My name is Armand.

1462
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:16,083
But call me Marselas if you want.

1463
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:27,250
I would rather not reveal my...

1464
01:53:27,625 --> 01:53:29,125
real name.

1465
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:32,167
"Teresa Victoria"...

1466
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:36,042
that was the name of my dear aunt.

1467
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:40,875
I actually always wanted to be "Teresa Victoria".

1468
01:53:41,042 --> 01:53:42,000
A beautiful name.

1469
01:53:42,167 --> 01:53:43,833
I like compound names.

1470
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:47,500
Names are used for your safety.

1471
01:53:49,417 --> 01:53:51,917
It's not easy when you're called by a foreign name.

1472
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:54,208
It's just a precaution.

1473
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,208
My name is Sebastiana.

1474
01:53:56,375 --> 01:53:57,625
I haven't changed it.

1475
01:53:57,792 --> 01:53:59,292
My name is Clovis.

1476
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,083
Just Clovis, actually.

1477
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,542
I wish I were as brave as you,

1478
01:54:12,083 --> 01:54:14,083
I really do.

1479
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,875
But it's not easy to live in the face of a deadly threat.

1480
01:54:23,708 --> 01:54:25,625
I am in the presence of a deadly threat.

1481
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:38,792
I am also in the presence of a deadly threat.

1482
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,500
Let's lighten up,

1483
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:42,583
I will play some music.

1484
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:46,083
Dona Sebastijana, I didn't mean to ruin the mood.

1485
01:54:46,292 --> 01:54:47,208
Help me.

1486
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:49,292
I said that because...

1487
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:52,292
I am alive, strong.

1488
01:54:52,458 --> 01:54:54,042
I have a son.

1489
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:57,875
I want to live.

1490
01:54:58,667 --> 01:55:00,167
Just...

1491
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:03,667
I found out today,

1492
01:55:04,333 --> 01:55:06,417
that death is imminent.

1493
01:55:07,375 --> 01:55:09,958
It was quite a surprise.

1494
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,875
For someone who conflicted with both sides in Angola,

1495
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:19,458
finding refuge here

1496
01:55:20,292 --> 01:55:21,792
was very good.

1497
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:25,500
Now Antonio and I are leaving.

1498
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:30,583
On a plane without the Portuguese flag, we insisted on that.

1499
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:32,750
Teresa, you talk too much.

1500
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:35,625
Dona Sebastijana,

1501
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,583
you are the best.

1502
01:55:37,917 --> 01:55:39,125
Thank you very much.

1503
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:41,833
You're welcome.

1504
01:55:42,375 --> 01:55:43,833
Where are you going, Teresa?

1505
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,667
There’s no need to talk about it.

1506
01:55:46,792 --> 01:55:48,042
But thank you.

1507
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:01,417
My niece Žeisa loved this song.

1508
01:56:01,792 --> 01:56:03,792
To be more precise, she loves it.

1509
01:56:06,333 --> 01:56:07,583
I think this is for me.

1510
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:15,333
Hello, Mr. Aleksandrai.

1511
01:56:17,542 --> 01:56:18,875
Good.

1512
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:22,958
We'll talk later, have a good evening.

1513
01:56:25,417 --> 01:56:29,125
I don't want to see you sad. Come and see my little museum.

1514
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:30,750
Look here...

1515
01:56:31,083 --> 01:56:33,042
This is my niece,

1516
01:56:33,417 --> 01:56:35,000
Žeisa, when she was little.

1517
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:37,208
Here she is already grown up.

1518
01:56:37,792 --> 01:56:38,792
And here are you?

1519
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:42,583
That's me with my boyfriend back then, Andrea.

1520
01:56:43,083 --> 01:56:44,958
It was in Italy, in Sassuolo.

1521
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:46,750
Really? You lived in Italy?

1522
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:50,792
For seven years. From 1936 to 1942.

1523
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:54,000
- You never told me that. - You never asked.

1524
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:57,042
I returned only after the war ended.

1525
01:56:57,375 --> 01:57:00,167
I went to Italy to study music.

1526
01:57:00,625 --> 01:57:04,167
And I stayed when everything started to go downhill.

1527
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:05,875
I couldn't go back.

1528
01:57:06,458 --> 01:57:10,083
I was a communist there. Then an anarchist.

1529
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,917
Or the other way around, I don't remember.

1530
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:17,208
I saw with my own eyes things,

1531
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:19,708
that I won't tell you about.

1532
01:57:20,583 --> 01:57:23,917
I’ll take them to the grave.

1533
01:57:25,042 --> 01:57:26,833
I also did three things there,

1534
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:29,125
that I won't tell you about.

1535
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,958
But I did them and I had to do them.

1536
01:57:32,667 --> 01:57:34,167
To finish up –

1537
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:37,000
a toast to all of you!

1538
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:38,208
A toast.

1539
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,667
- To my friend Žeraldas. - Thank you.

1540
01:57:41,833 --> 01:57:45,167
Life has its bad things, but there are also good ones.

1541
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:47,375
To Harold, who is not Harold.

1542
01:57:47,542 --> 01:57:48,750
To Marcel,

1543
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:50,333
who is Armands.

1544
01:57:50,833 --> 01:57:54,333
To this woman, who is Teresa Victoria to me.

1545
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:57,417
She is going to Sweden with Antonijus.

1546
01:57:58,375 --> 01:57:59,917
A toast to Claudia,

1547
01:58:00,333 --> 01:58:01,792
who is Claudia.

1548
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:04,083
And to Deborah,

1549
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:07,708
who, I’m sure, will live in a better Brazil.

1550
01:58:07,875 --> 01:58:10,958
She will grow up in a better Brazil, with less evil.

1551
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:12,958
To everyone’s health.

1552
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:14,333
To health.

1553
01:58:17,458 --> 01:58:19,500
Thank you, Dona Sebastijana.

1554
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:55,875
Calmly.

1555
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:58,542
Look at me, I am here.

1556
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:11,250
PART 3. BLOOD TRANSFUSION

1557
01:59:12,667 --> 01:59:14,042
Damn it!

1558
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,500
Vilmarai.

1559
01:59:54,583 --> 01:59:55,625
Mr. Bobis.

1560
01:59:55,792 --> 01:59:57,083
Mr. Augustas.

1561
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:08,375
Is this the man?

1562
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:09,750
This is the man.

1563
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:15,708
I inquired, they say you are the man.

1564
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:18,542
I don’t know.

1565
02:00:19,292 --> 02:00:20,542
Is he capable of doing the job?

1566
02:00:21,167 --> 02:00:22,333
Yes, he is capable.

1567
02:00:22,875 --> 02:00:24,875
The job is here, in Recife.

1568
02:00:25,708 --> 02:00:28,917
It requires a lot of responsibility and reliability.

1569
02:00:29,958 --> 02:00:31,417
Poor or rich?

1570
02:00:31,583 --> 02:00:33,417
Hell knows!

1571
02:00:34,292 --> 02:00:37,875
Looks lavish, but is not rich.

1572
02:00:38,042 --> 02:00:40,125
Looks luxurious and is rich.

1573
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:41,833
It will be more expensive.

1574
02:00:43,167 --> 02:00:44,333
Does he have a gun?

1575
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,583
No.

1576
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,125
He is a coward.

1577
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:49,917
I will do it for 4,000.

1578
02:00:50,208 --> 02:00:51,333
Damn it!

1579
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:58,292
What do you use for the job?

1580
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,833
Medium length: 38.

1581
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,333
Accuracy guaranteed.

1582
02:01:03,792 --> 02:01:05,750
I’ll give 2,000.

1583
02:01:07,542 --> 02:01:09,833
The price is 4,000. I’ll do it for 4,000.

1584
02:01:11,458 --> 02:01:13,833
You work this shoddy job,

1585
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:17,667
carrying sugar like an animal, for cents.

1586
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,417
It's an easy job.

1587
02:01:21,583 --> 02:01:25,292
We have information that will help you.

1588
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:29,167
“Like an animal”...

1589
02:01:29,333 --> 02:01:30,500
I don’t like how you speak.

1590
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:35,583
This is our man.

1591
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,292
4,000.

1592
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:47,167
4,000 agreed.

1593
02:01:48,417 --> 02:01:50,042
But you’re going now.

1594
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:51,375
2,000 in advance.

1595
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:52,917
Right now.

1596
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:07,000
Severinai. I need to leave.

1597
02:02:07,167 --> 02:02:08,917
- For half an hour. - Okay.

1598
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:10,792
- You are responsible. - Of course.

1599
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,542
if Santa Cruz Wins Today,

1600
02:02:56,708 --> 02:02:58,042
I’ll buy beer.

1601
02:02:59,125 --> 02:03:00,458
I’ll be back soon.

1602
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:01,917
Okay, Aleksandrai.

1603
02:03:26,708 --> 02:03:28,083
- SORRY. - Hello.

1604
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:30,375
- Is Mr. Aleksandras here? - he just left.

1605
02:03:30,542 --> 02:03:31,583
Really?

1606
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:34,792
Too Bad.

1607
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:07,708
Hairy foot stole that Leg from the morgue

1608
02:05:15,125 --> 02:05:16,792
Marija Aparesida dos Santos

1609
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:18,167
Marija Aparesida dos Santos

1610
02:05:19,292 --> 02:05:21,208
Marija Aparesida dos Santos

1611
02:05:22,083 --> 02:05:23,083
Marija Aparesida dos Santos

1612
02:05:34,917 --> 02:05:36,667
Mary Augusta?

1613
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:39,083
- Mary aparesida? - Mary aparesida.

1614
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,625
There aren't that many of them.

1615
02:05:43,625 --> 02:05:45,083
Is sher mother?

1616
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:53,042
You are determined, aren’t you?

1617
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,750
My mother passed away; I would like to have her documents.

1618
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:01,208
Even if just one.

1619
02:06:03,667 --> 02:06:07,083
And I know her identity card was issued here.

1620
02:06:08,292 --> 02:06:10,708
I am determined to find the file.

1621
02:06:12,625 --> 02:06:14,625
I hope you do.

1622
02:06:47,958 --> 02:06:49,042
Good morning.

1623
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:13,250
- Good morning, boss. - Good morning.

1624
02:07:13,917 --> 02:07:15,875
Are identity cards issued here?

1625
02:07:16,042 --> 02:07:17,208
Yes, sir.

1626
02:07:35,708 --> 02:07:38,167
Brenda Oliveira da Mata.

1627
02:07:38,333 --> 02:07:39,958
I just need to talk to someone.

1628
02:07:40,292 --> 02:07:41,375
Maria Eugenija...

1629
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:42,708
Armando.

1630
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:47,500
His name is Marselas.

1631
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:50,208
Elisandžela, you can let him in.

1632
02:08:05,875 --> 02:08:08,000
- Is everything okay? - I called you Armando.

1633
02:08:08,167 --> 02:08:09,458
- How about Fernandas? - Good.

1634
02:08:09,625 --> 02:08:11,542
He asked me to pass this to you.

1635
02:08:12,333 --> 02:08:13,625
I had to swear,

1636
02:08:13,792 --> 02:08:16,250
that I would come in the morning.

1637
02:08:25,542 --> 02:08:26,875
Turn it over.

1638
02:08:31,292 --> 02:08:32,375
"Dad,

1639
02:08:33,292 --> 02:08:36,333
Grandpa and Grandma are very nice,

1640
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:41,667
but I want to live with you.

1641
02:08:46,083 --> 02:08:49,458
I think I'm starting

1642
02:08:49,625 --> 02:08:52,417
to forget Mom.

1643
02:08:53,542 --> 02:08:54,833
Come back soon,

1644
02:08:55,958 --> 02:08:57,250
Fernandas."

1645
02:09:14,667 --> 02:09:16,917
You take my grandson.

1646
02:09:18,458 --> 02:09:20,417
I'm taking my son.

1647
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:24,792
And you should take him.

1648
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:26,292
You should take him.

1649
02:09:27,458 --> 02:09:28,708
I need to go.

1650
02:09:29,458 --> 02:09:31,292
Did you find your mother's document?

1651
02:09:42,167 --> 02:09:44,708
Klaudija Andrade Lima Melo.

1652
02:09:48,708 --> 02:09:50,125
I'm sorry...

1653
02:09:52,458 --> 02:09:55,167
Mariana da Roša Pineiro.

1654
02:09:57,875 --> 02:09:59,083
Mariana?

1655
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:11,708
Thank you.

1656
02:10:12,917 --> 02:10:16,042
Next, Kaua Baros Campos.

1657
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,667
Demostenis Gera Fereira.

1658
02:10:53,167 --> 02:10:54,958
- I'm sorry. - Yes?

1659
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:56,625
Is he Armando?

1660
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:05,792
No.

1661
02:11:06,417 --> 02:11:08,000
His name is Marselas.

1662
02:11:08,167 --> 02:11:08,917
Armando.

1663
02:11:20,917 --> 02:11:22,042
Armando!

1664
02:11:25,292 --> 02:11:27,208
His name is not Armando.

1665
02:12:16,417 --> 02:12:19,542
Take a few guys, intimidate him.

1666
02:12:19,708 --> 02:12:21,917
We only have two patrol cars.

1667
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:23,583
I'm sorry.

1668
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:25,417
Commander Euclides, I'm sorry.

1669
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:26,667
Yes, Marselas.

1670
02:12:27,417 --> 02:12:29,417
I need to talk to you.

1671
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:30,708
Please.

1672
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,083
You know I don't carry a weapon.

1673
02:12:35,083 --> 02:12:37,125
We are under-protected down there.

1674
02:12:38,708 --> 02:12:40,167
A man like that

1675
02:12:40,333 --> 02:12:42,917
appeared, harassing girls.

1676
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,250
What the hell.

1677
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:46,417
He threatened me...

1678
02:12:47,792 --> 02:12:50,458
He’s causing problems, that’s why I came to you.

1679
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:55,083
You need a weapon, buddy.

1680
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:57,375
Makes you respected.

1681
02:12:59,542 --> 02:13:01,125
Stretch out your hand.

1682
02:13:02,458 --> 02:13:03,417
Stretch...

1683
02:13:03,583 --> 02:13:05,375
Your hand, he wants to see your hand.

1684
02:13:05,542 --> 02:13:06,750
Stretch it out.

1685
02:13:10,417 --> 02:13:11,250
That's right.

1686
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:13,625
You're getting nervous.

1687
02:13:15,917 --> 02:13:17,583
Have you met his wife?

1688
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:19,667
No, I don’t know him.

1689
02:13:19,833 --> 02:13:21,375
He’s down there now.

1690
02:13:22,458 --> 02:13:23,917
Commander Euclides...

1691
02:13:26,083 --> 02:13:28,000
I wouldn’t have come here

1692
02:13:28,167 --> 02:13:29,833
to ask for your help,

1693
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,708
if I didn't think it was a dangerous situation.

1694
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:35,750
- Arlindai? - Yes?

1695
02:13:35,917 --> 02:13:37,250
Go check.

1696
02:13:37,875 --> 02:13:39,667
Right away, I’m eager.

1697
02:13:39,833 --> 02:13:41,583
- Let’s go. - Thank you, commander.

1698
02:13:43,875 --> 02:13:46,042
Let’s go together, something is happening.

1699
02:13:46,208 --> 02:13:48,792
- Do we really have to go now? - It’s quick here.

1700
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,583
Scammers and con artists

1701
02:14:00,875 --> 02:14:02,000
Lieutenant.

1702
02:14:02,167 --> 02:14:03,292
Hey, lieutenant.

1703
02:14:04,167 --> 02:14:05,250
You have a call.

1704
02:14:19,708 --> 02:14:22,083
Mr. Augustas, this is Vilmaras.

1705
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:24,042
I found a man.

1706
02:14:24,208 --> 02:14:25,542
Where?

1707
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,458
In the office where they issue identity cards.

1708
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,875
Is it really him?

1709
02:14:33,042 --> 02:14:34,292
Definitely.

1710
02:14:35,042 --> 02:14:36,958
I looked closely.

1711
02:14:51,417 --> 02:14:52,750
Shall we go all the way?

1712
02:14:55,417 --> 02:14:57,500
Is Bobis with you?

1713
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:00,792
No, he stayed at the cinema.

1714
02:15:01,917 --> 02:15:03,125
That's better.

1715
02:15:04,625 --> 02:15:05,792
Get rid of him.

1716
02:15:05,958 --> 02:15:07,000
I'll get rid of him.

1717
02:15:07,167 --> 02:15:08,250
Right in the nose.

1718
02:15:08,417 --> 02:15:10,000
He's in the phone booth.

1719
02:15:13,875 --> 02:15:16,083
That guy with the red hat?

1720
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,375
Let's go, Markas.

1721
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:27,542
I have your remaining money.

1722
02:15:29,542 --> 02:15:30,708
Hey, man...

1723
02:15:31,083 --> 02:15:32,625
Are you bothering our friend?

1724
02:15:34,667 --> 02:15:36,167
Show us your passport.

1725
02:15:39,458 --> 02:15:40,917
You know, I know this guy.

1726
02:15:42,375 --> 02:15:43,917
I forgot my passport today.

1727
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,042
Shots fired!

1728
02:16:39,292 --> 02:16:41,458
There's a shootout over there. It's a real hell.

1729
02:16:44,417 --> 02:16:46,000
Damn.

1730
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,542
Don't do tomorrow

1731
02:16:57,708 --> 02:17:01,750
what you can do the day after tomorrow!

1732
02:17:02,125 --> 02:17:04,708
Long live procrastination!

1733
02:17:04,875 --> 02:17:08,083
Long live collective inaction!

1734
02:17:14,958 --> 02:17:16,833
The man with the red hat?

1735
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,125
That way?

1736
02:17:34,708 --> 02:17:38,083
Free love costs more!

1737
02:17:44,833 --> 02:17:45,958
Social insurance

1738
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:49,125
the so-called foresight!

1739
02:17:49,292 --> 02:17:53,167
Desires just keep growing!

1740
02:17:58,667 --> 02:18:01,208
Neither the future nor glory means anything!

1741
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:05,625
What I see – it's just the wind!

1742
02:18:05,792 --> 02:18:08,958
Look at the books, look – the books!

1743
02:18:17,917 --> 02:18:19,375
Help us...

1744
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:29,792
Where is Arlindas?

1745
02:18:31,708 --> 02:18:33,875
– Did you see what happened?
– Yes.

1746
02:18:44,792 --> 02:18:46,500
Yet another true love.

1747
02:18:47,375 --> 02:18:48,917
Love is rebellious.

1748
02:18:49,125 --> 02:18:51,083
It doesn't grow in a cage.

1749
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:54,417
She needs freedom.

1750
02:18:55,167 --> 02:18:56,833
She doesn't beg for alms.

1751
02:18:58,375 --> 02:19:00,500
Seek your own and live it,

1752
02:19:00,875 --> 02:19:02,375
while it’s still here

1753
02:19:03,333 --> 02:19:05,292
and never returned.

1754
02:19:06,583 --> 02:19:08,833
I am a plant, I have roots,

1755
02:19:10,333 --> 02:19:12,292
I am a beast of the forest,

1756
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,208
walking free and happy,

1757
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:18,292
following my destiny,
earning money – there will be more tomorrow.

1758
02:19:24,083 --> 02:19:26,667
My path must be free,

1759
02:19:26,958 --> 02:19:28,625
He doesn’t beg for alms.

1760
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:32,792
So take care of your love while it’s still here.

1761
02:19:38,542 --> 02:19:40,458
These cases cannot be taken out of the room.

1762
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:45,042
All lines are occupied due to what happened.

1763
02:19:50,417 --> 02:19:53,708
Tell me, your name is not Marsel, right?

1764
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:15,542
"Like an animal"...

1765
02:21:25,875 --> 02:21:27,000
Elza.

1766
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:31,292
I need the passports now.

1767
02:21:32,792 --> 02:21:33,875
Elza...

1768
02:21:34,625 --> 02:21:36,375
My time in Recife is over.

1769
02:21:54,875 --> 02:21:57,667
Step back! Scatter!

1770
02:22:20,292 --> 02:22:22,833
CARNIVAL COUNT: 91 DEATHS

1771
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:28,958
SOUTHERN TOURIST SHOT BY A BARBER

1772
02:22:35,083 --> 02:22:37,625
The motive could have been revenge.

1773
02:22:46,208 --> 02:22:47,000
Dani.

1774
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:51,708
Dani.

1775
02:22:54,125 --> 02:22:55,083
Yes, Flavia?

1776
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,208
Speak.

1777
02:22:56,375 --> 02:23:00,542
Have you tried to find out what happened to these people?

1778
02:23:01,625 --> 02:23:04,000
You know that I'm a bit worried?

1779
02:23:04,167 --> 02:23:08,750
I tried searching online, but there's nothing.

1780
02:23:08,917 --> 02:23:10,375
They all lived before the Google era.

1781
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:12,458
We need to review the newspapers.

1782
02:23:13,792 --> 02:23:15,792
Yes, but there will be more work.

1783
02:23:15,958 --> 02:23:19,417
I'm listening to Anisijus, who tried to help Armand, you know?

1784
02:23:19,958 --> 02:23:22,125
You've gone back to Armand's case?

1785
02:23:22,292 --> 02:23:25,042
It shook you a bit, didn’t it?

1786
02:23:25,708 --> 02:23:28,250
Yes, I needed a break from that.

1787
02:23:31,958 --> 02:23:33,167
Well...

1788
02:23:33,917 --> 02:23:37,625
I don't know why, but this guy's story touched me.

1789
02:23:39,208 --> 02:23:42,000
Probably because my family is from Pernambuco.

1790
02:23:42,167 --> 02:23:45,250
My grandfather, who was practically my father.

1791
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:52,833
I liked listening to Armand's voice in the headphones.

1792
02:23:55,833 --> 02:23:58,000
He had a nice voice.

1793
02:24:11,042 --> 02:24:14,708
THE MURDERED SCIENTIST WAS ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION.

1794
02:24:15,417 --> 02:24:16,625
Take him?

1795
02:24:32,958 --> 02:24:36,042
Armandas Solimojesas, 43, shot...

1796
02:24:36,208 --> 02:24:38,667
The crime is considered contracted.

1797
02:24:47,708 --> 02:24:49,000
Say "daddy."

1798
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,125
Thank you, goodbye.

1799
02:25:16,208 --> 02:25:17,667
– Good evening.
– Good evening.

1800
02:25:17,833 --> 02:25:20,750
I would like to meet with Dr. Fernando de Melo Solimojes.

1801
02:25:20,917 --> 02:25:22,375
He is waiting for me.

1802
02:25:22,542 --> 02:25:24,083
Dr. Fernando.

1803
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,000
– Flavia, right?
– Exactly.

1804
02:25:26,167 --> 02:25:27,792
Are you a donor?

1805
02:25:29,958 --> 02:25:31,042
Yes.

1806
02:25:31,208 --> 02:25:32,542
How much do you weigh?

1807
02:25:32,708 --> 02:25:35,042
52 kilograms.

1808
02:25:50,458 --> 02:25:51,667
Flavia?

1809
02:25:53,458 --> 02:25:54,958
Dr. Fernando.

1810
02:25:55,625 --> 02:25:57,375
Very nice to meet you.

1811
02:25:57,875 --> 02:25:58,708
How are you?

1812
02:25:58,875 --> 02:26:02,167
I was joking when I said I would only meet if you donate blood.

1813
02:26:03,292 --> 02:26:05,042
Still, it's for the good.

1814
02:26:05,208 --> 02:26:07,583
It's my first time donating blood.

1815
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,375
You are in good hands.
Right, Roza?

1816
02:26:10,542 --> 02:26:11,750
Everything is fine.

1817
02:26:12,375 --> 02:26:14,167
Can I see my blood?

1818
02:26:19,083 --> 02:26:20,375
From Minas Gerais?

1819
02:26:21,708 --> 02:26:24,833
Yes, but I lived in São Paulo for a few years.

1820
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,500
At first, I didn't want to,

1821
02:26:28,667 --> 02:26:31,125
but I'm glad I did.

1822
02:26:32,792 --> 02:26:34,667
- Can I take this?
- Yes, please.

1823
02:26:34,833 --> 02:26:35,958
Thank you, Roza.

1824
02:26:36,125 --> 02:26:37,083
Thank you, Roza.

1825
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:41,042
Now for a snack, I’ll get her some chocolate milk.

1826
02:26:44,333 --> 02:26:46,750
I know your father spent some time

1827
02:26:46,917 --> 02:26:49,792
looking for your mother’s identity document

1828
02:26:49,958 --> 02:26:51,625
here in Recife, right?

1829
02:26:51,792 --> 02:26:53,292
It's recorded on tapes.

1830
02:26:53,458 --> 02:26:55,250
You see, I don't know...

1831
02:26:55,417 --> 02:26:57,167
I didn't know that.

1832
02:26:57,583 --> 02:26:59,917
About my paternal grandmother,

1833
02:27:00,083 --> 02:27:01,917
I only know her name,

1834
02:27:02,083 --> 02:27:04,125
"Maria Aparesida dos Santos,"

1835
02:27:04,292 --> 02:27:05,792
also known as "the Indian."

1836
02:27:05,958 --> 02:27:07,667
That's all I know.

1837
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:12,875
Do you have any documents about your grandmother?

1838
02:27:13,042 --> 02:27:14,750
Nothing. I have never seen her.

1839
02:27:14,917 --> 02:27:16,458
No photos, nothing.

1840
02:27:16,625 --> 02:27:17,958
No records at all.

1841
02:27:20,208 --> 02:27:22,250
From my paternal grandfather

1842
02:27:22,417 --> 02:27:24,000
she got pregnant

1843
02:27:24,167 --> 02:27:27,042
by a maid's daughter from Bonito,

1844
02:27:27,208 --> 02:27:28,958
here in Pernambuco.

1845
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:31,792
My grandfather was 17,

1846
02:27:31,958 --> 02:27:34,417
and my grandmother was 14, still a child.

1847
02:27:34,583 --> 02:27:36,250
She was like...

1848
02:27:38,583 --> 02:27:41,583
She did all the housework.

1849
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:44,292
She was like a maid...

1850
02:27:44,458 --> 02:27:45,708
Like...

1851
02:27:46,292 --> 02:27:47,958
enslaved... or captured.

1852
02:27:48,125 --> 02:27:49,667
I don't know...

1853
02:27:50,208 --> 02:27:52,167
She was definitely enslaved.

1854
02:27:54,083 --> 02:27:58,458
And my grandmother was known as...

1855
02:27:58,625 --> 02:28:01,917
Everyone called her "the Indian," just "the Indian."

1856
02:28:02,708 --> 02:28:05,042
And my father, her son...

1857
02:28:05,833 --> 02:28:09,167
Everyone said he was a "handsome" boy.

1858
02:28:10,167 --> 02:28:12,417
So she was "the Indian,"

1859
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:15,125
and my father was "handsome."

1860
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:18,042
You see?

1861
02:28:19,708 --> 02:28:21,250
It's not simple.

1862
02:28:21,542 --> 02:28:26,042
It's very hard for me to talk about this...

1863
02:28:26,208 --> 02:28:28,583
I do it because you insisted.

1864
02:28:30,208 --> 02:28:33,708
You are really not just anyone,
you sent emails, you called...

1865
02:28:33,875 --> 02:28:37,000
But it's hard for me to talk about it.

1866
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,667
But...

1867
02:28:39,833 --> 02:28:41,875
And your father Armand?

1868
02:28:42,042 --> 02:28:43,292
My father Armand

1869
02:28:43,458 --> 02:28:45,708
was born from that relationship

1870
02:28:45,875 --> 02:28:50,542
between a 17-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl.

1871
02:28:51,083 --> 02:28:52,042
And...

1872
02:28:52,208 --> 02:28:56,000
The wealthy side of the family...
"wealthy," so to speak...

1873
02:28:56,167 --> 02:28:58,708
That is my grandfather's family.

1874
02:28:59,333 --> 02:29:01,167
They took my father to raise him,

1875
02:29:01,333 --> 02:29:04,583
while his mother could do nothing,
she was a child.

1876
02:29:08,125 --> 02:29:11,417
Listen, Fernanda, here’s what happened:

1877
02:29:11,833 --> 02:29:15,292
I work at a private university,

1878
02:29:15,583 --> 02:29:19,000
which paid me to transcribe the tapes

1879
02:29:19,167 --> 02:29:21,667
from the archive.

1880
02:29:21,958 --> 02:29:26,250
And now they want to recover the tapes,

1881
02:29:26,417 --> 02:29:30,667
in my opinion because
they contain sensitive information.

1882
02:29:31,167 --> 02:29:34,083
So they asked for all the tapes back.

1883
02:29:34,958 --> 02:29:36,917
But it doesn’t matter,

1884
02:29:37,083 --> 02:29:40,458
because I made copies of all the recordings.

1885
02:29:42,417 --> 02:29:44,292
I said you were not just anyone, right?

1886
02:29:45,583 --> 02:29:49,542
But that's the reason
I came.

1887
02:29:49,708 --> 02:29:53,000
I enjoyed listening to your father's testimony.

1888
02:29:53,708 --> 02:29:55,958
Hearing how people talked about him.

1889
02:29:56,125 --> 02:29:57,833
Flavia...

1890
02:29:58,667 --> 02:30:02,042
How did those recordings reach you?

1891
02:30:03,458 --> 02:30:05,750
Through Sara Gebert's daughter,

1892
02:30:05,917 --> 02:30:08,958
your father knew her as "Elza,"

1893
02:30:09,125 --> 02:30:11,417
when he was being hunted.

1894
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,917
Flavia, I don't want to delve into this.

1895
02:30:23,833 --> 02:30:24,875
Okay?

1896
02:30:27,458 --> 02:30:28,875
Okay.

1897
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,667
Actually...

1898
02:30:34,042 --> 02:30:35,625
I brought this,

1899
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,292
with all the recordings I copied.

1900
02:30:38,917 --> 02:30:40,417
Everything I received,

1901
02:30:40,958 --> 02:30:42,667
is here.

1902
02:30:43,208 --> 02:30:45,167
Your father's voice is here,

1903
02:30:45,667 --> 02:30:47,958
and people talking about him.

1904
02:30:49,042 --> 02:30:50,042
It's yours.

1905
02:30:50,208 --> 02:30:53,875
You can take it and do whatever you want.

1906
02:31:05,958 --> 02:31:08,458
You know, my grandfather Alexander...

1907
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,417
who raised me

1908
02:31:13,208 --> 02:31:15,500
and whom I consider my father...

1909
02:31:17,875 --> 02:31:19,458
He told me that...

1910
02:31:19,625 --> 02:31:21,833
He always used to tell this story.

1911
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,292
When my father...

1912
02:31:25,167 --> 02:31:28,167
On the day my father died,
I had just washed up and was ready.

1913
02:31:28,333 --> 02:31:31,917
I chose my favorite clothes and stood

1914
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:35,208
by the house, waiting for him.

1915
02:31:35,375 --> 02:31:38,833
He planned to come pick me up.

1916
02:31:39,708 --> 02:31:43,958
To be honest, I don't remember that.

1917
02:31:44,958 --> 02:31:48,000
Sometimes when someone else tells,
you create a memory.

1918
02:31:48,167 --> 02:31:51,375
But I don't know if I remember that day.

1919
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:57,958
I talk to you about him, but I...

1920
02:31:58,333 --> 02:32:01,208
In fact, I don't remember him.

1921
02:32:03,625 --> 02:32:05,417
In fact,

1922
02:32:05,958 --> 02:32:09,500
you remember my father more than I do.

1923
02:32:26,667 --> 02:32:28,500
I don't think I helped you much.

1924
02:32:28,667 --> 02:32:29,917
It's all right.

1925
02:32:30,083 --> 02:32:32,083
It was wonderful to meet you.

1926
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:35,458
This trip to Recife is also an opportunity for me

1927
02:32:35,625 --> 02:32:40,125
to meet relatives,
whom I only know by phone.

1928
02:32:40,292 --> 02:32:41,917
Do you have family here?

1929
02:32:42,083 --> 02:32:43,750
My grandfather is from here.

1930
02:32:43,917 --> 02:32:46,458
He worked for the family

1931
02:32:46,625 --> 02:32:49,417
not far from here, at the Crying Boy Square.

1932
02:32:51,042 --> 02:32:55,375
I like the name "Crying Boy."
It's a great name for a square.

1933
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,042
I've heard about that place since I was a child.

1934
02:33:00,208 --> 02:33:02,708
I just happened to end up here.

1935
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,375
Do you want to hear about the coincidence?

1936
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:08,875
When I was little,

1937
02:33:09,542 --> 02:33:11,875
I really wanted to see the movie "Nasrai."

1938
02:33:12,042 --> 02:33:13,458
– I know.
– You know?

1939
02:33:14,292 --> 02:33:16,458
My grandfather wouldn’t let me,

1940
02:33:16,625 --> 02:33:18,625
just the poster scared me –

1941
02:33:18,792 --> 02:33:21,250
a hand with big jaws.

1942
02:33:21,417 --> 02:33:25,542
He was a movie projector operator at the San Luis cinema.

1943
02:33:26,042 --> 02:33:28,167
One day, he took me to see it.

1944
02:33:28,333 --> 02:33:29,667
Unexpectedly.

1945
02:33:30,375 --> 02:33:31,917
I got ready and went.

1946
02:33:32,083 --> 02:33:36,875
Since the day I saw the movie,
nightmares about the shark disappeared.

1947
02:33:37,875 --> 02:33:39,667
There's the coincidence.

1948
02:33:39,833 --> 02:33:41,375
Guess where I saw the movie.

1949
02:33:41,542 --> 02:33:44,042
I don't know any local cinemas.

1950
02:33:44,208 --> 02:33:45,500
Right here.

1951
02:33:46,792 --> 02:33:48,167
There used to be a cinema here?

1952
02:33:48,333 --> 02:33:52,083
The Boa Vista cinema, where I watched "Jaws."

1953
02:33:52,667 --> 02:33:54,750
– It's changed a lot.
– It's changed.

1954
02:33:54,917 --> 02:33:56,417
It's a completely different place.

1955
02:33:56,958 --> 02:33:59,083
And I work here now.

1956
02:34:03,208 --> 02:34:04,958
– Your car?
– It's already here.

1957
02:34:06,042 --> 02:34:07,542
Thank you, Fernanda.

1958
02:34:07,708 --> 02:34:09,083
Thank you.

1959
02:36:54,417 --> 02:36:57,458
SECRET AGENT

1960
02:37:05,667 --> 02:37:08,125
The production and distribution of this film were
financed from public and private funds,

1961
02:37:08,167 --> 02:37:10,542
creating more than 1300
direct and indirect jobs.

1962
02:37:10,583 --> 02:37:13,167
Moreover, culture is not only part of a country's identity –
it is also an industry.
